# Arduino Rover Project

This is the Arduino portion of a 6-week summer learning project where I worked one day each week on a different skill to build a rover from scratch. Here, I'm learning how to use an Arduino while using a SparkFun RedBoard and other components.

## Hardware Used:
- SparkFun RedBoard (Arduino compatible)
- Breadboard, resistors, buttons, LEDs
- Servo motor, fan, speaker, solar panel
- Ultrasonic sensor, RGB LEDs
- 3D-printed parts (chassis, mounts)

## Weekly Breakdown:

| Week | Focus | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| 1 | Basics (LEDs, buttons, code setup) | Done |
| 2 | PWM, servo motor control | Upcoming |
| 3 | Sensors, analog input, and conditional logic | Upcoming |
| 4 | Rover control logic + driving control | Upcoming |
| 5 | Rover assembly + testing | Upcoming |
| 6 | Final rover project | Upcoming |

## Folders
Each week's code and notes are organized in folders like `Week1/`, `Week2/`, and such.

As I build my general knowledge in all that is robotics.
